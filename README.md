1. Load the packcage
2. Load de data with readr function skip names en separate by space
3. Join set train whit the subject en activity with cbind function made the same to test set, then use rbond function to merge test data with train data 
4. Calculate mean and standar deviation skiping subject and activity columns 
5. Load name's activity and join with the data set with the fubction left_join of tidyverse package 
6. Load name's variable and apply regular expression to obtain the names of the data set 
7. Finally, apply group_by funtion to split the data set by subject and activity the using summarise_at function you could calculate the mean for each variable of the data_set

Thanks for see my assigment
